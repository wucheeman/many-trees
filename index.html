        <p>Many Trees is a historic farm in Durham, Carolina. It offers a significant opportunity to preserve part of North Carolina's history as well as wildlife habitat. Located in the midst of a rapidly growing area, Many Trees could provide excellent educational facilities for teaching about plantation slavery, local plants and animals, and even organic farming. A portion of the site could be developed as a pocket neighborhood as well. Many Trees's current owner is seeking a buyer or government agency that might purchase the site or accept some or all of it in perpetuity. Keep reading to learn about Many Trees and how its promise can be turned into a reality.</p>

        <p><b>Native Americans:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the arrival of white settlers in the 1750s peoples of the Shakori, Eno, and  Sissipahaw tribes lived in the area. They formed a part of a larger trade network, as evidenced by the many arrowheads and other stone tools that turn up when the ground on Forty Oaks is plowed or dug. Three examples from Forty Oaks appear on the left. Their trading partners provided roughed-in 'blanks' that the local peoples could finish. In return, they would have provided corn or perhaps tobacco and other agricultural products.</p>
        <p>Under pressure from the colonists, the native peoples of the area may have joined in the Yamasee War of 1715. At one point their successes in the war threatened the continuation of the colony of South Carolina. Following the defeat of the Native Americans in 1717, these tribes shriveled in size and eventually merged into the Catawba tribe, which remains in existence today.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-7">
        <p><b>Slavery & the Civil War:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Trees was built prior to the Civil War, most likely in 1857 by Fendol Southerland as his home as he built out a cotton plantation on some newly acquired land. Southerland owned 32 slaves who planted, harvested, and processed the cotton. In addition, they dug ditches to drain the land as well as probably cleared it of timber and built the main house, barn, and other outbuildings. As a part of their work, they also built a giant wheel that powered a cotton gin to process the raw cotton and a giant press to form it into bales. The wheel still stands in the barn on the property and is  pictured on the left. By the start of the Civil War, Many Trees was one of the three largest cotton producers in Orange County.</p>
        <p>Many Trees stands near the site of some of the last combat in the Civil War. Following their defeat at Bentonville, Confederate troops retreated through the area. Confederate cavalry deployed to protect their line of march along the line of the nearby New Hope Creek and Stagecoach Road. On April 15, 1865, Union cavalry attacked across the New Hope in the vicinity of Many Trees. After four hours of fighting, the Confederates withdrew, perhaps saving Many Trees from being burned as many plantations were late in the war. The Confederates surrendered three days later in nearby Durham, effectively ending the war.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-7">
        <p><b>After the Civil War:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Southerland remained on his former plantation and continued growing cotton. In the late 1870s, growing global competition significantly depressed prices from pre-Civil War levels. For planters who lived on credit, as most did, this was disastrous. Southerland was among those affected. In 1878, in failing health, he committed suicide. Around this time, the main house would have looked like the picture to the left. Southerland's granddaughter continued farming the land for decades until the early 1900s. Many Trees was next briefly owned by a famous University of North Carolina professor, Horace Williams. Between 1909 and 1940, the property passed through the hads of a series of land and timber companies. Many of the fields disappeared under new growth forest and the buildings crumbled. In 1940, the Mayor of Chapel Hill, John xxxxxxx, as well as his wife, Ola Maie, bought the property and began to restore it. They lived on the farm for more than fifty years</p>

June has continued her parents' work restoring the farm, rebuilding the barn from a state of near collapse to where it appears as it would have during the time of slavery.</p>

        <p><b>Historical Preservation:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Preservation of Many Trees would have both direct and indirect benefits to the Durham community and beyond. It could be used as a facility to teach school children and the public about the role of cotton and slavery in the antebellum South. Slave cabins could be rebuilt and then used with the restored farm house  to contrast the living conditions of master and slave. Preserving Many Trees would also lead to jobs for the people who preserve and maintain it.</p>
        <p>As Preservation North Carolina notes, historic preservation of one property inspires further preservation elsewhere, adding to the local tax base and stimulating economic development. It adds to the 'cultural capital' of a locale, attracting tourism.</p>
        <p>Historic preservation of Many Trees is consistent with preserving wildlife habitat, providing an educational facility, or even development of a portion of the property.</p>

        <p><b>Wild Life Preserve:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;You might see a great blue heron take flight from the pond as you turn in the front to drive. Lesser green herons and hawks also inhabit the edge of the pond, watching for prey. Fox abound, and although they are officially red or gray, June has seen a solid black one and one that was bright orange all over. Of course, there are the graceful deer as well. as well as wild turkeys, turkey vultures, bats, and song birds.</p>
        <p><i>Add information about trees or other flora?</i></p>
        <p>Many Trees is located near several major roads, and  development is removing habitat all around it. This has already led to loss of some species. For instance, June no longer sees flying squirrels, bobwhite, or whippoorwill. The need to preserve what remains is becoming intense if more species are not to be lost.</p>

        <p>The guest room is June's favorite room in which to awaken. As part of the building that was originally the kitchen, it has three exterior sides, with wonderful large windows in two, and a 15-pane glass door to the patio in the third. The original wood ceiling is exposed and a silent ceiling fan moves the air on a warm night.</p>
        <p>The adjacent study has a built-in single bed and large 14-foot arched window from the old Alberto Mill in nearby Carrboro. Each room has its own bath.</p>

        <p>Many Trees has two buildings that could be rented to supplement other sources of income from the farm. The first is the log cabin shown to the right. Once a tobacco barn, it has been expanded and had plumbing and electricity added. It would be ideal for a student or writer. The second was originally a smokehouse, built by Southerland in the 1850s to cure hams. It also has been expanded, with plumbing, electricity, and a kitchen added. Both units offer privacy from the main house.</p>

        <p><b>Education:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from its potential for teaching North Carolina history, Many Trees has many possible uses as an educational facility. If used as a wildlife preserve, it could be used to teach about the ecology of the North Carolina Piedmont. If converted to an organic farm, it could also be used as a teaching facility for organic farming techniques. In any of these uses, Many Trees could also provide a place to hold art classes, teach tai chi chuan or yoga, provide horseback lessons, or any other form of instruction that benefits from being held outdoors.</p>

        <p><b>Pocket Neighborhood:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;As described by Wikipedia, a pocket neighborhood is a type of planned community that consists of a grouping of smaller residences, often around a courtyard or common garden, designed to promote a close knit sense of community and neighborliness with an increased level of contact. Environmental considerations often play a role in the creation of a pocket neighborhood. They reduce parking and roadways, and feature homes with smaller square footage built in close proximity to one another. Homes are designed to maximize space and use porch areas, encouraging time spent outside in the focal greenspace. The photo shows a pocket neighborhood in Washington state and suggests what one built on Many Trees might look like.</p>
