        <p>Many Trees is a historic farm in Durham County, North Carolina. It offers a significant opportunity to preserve part of North Carolina's history as well as wildlife habitat. Located in the midst of a rapidly growing area, Many Trees could provide excellent educational facilities for teaching about plantation slavery, local plants and animals, and  organic farming. Many Trees's current owner is seeking a buyer with similar goals to purchase the site. The purpose of this site is to share those goals and present the promise of Many Trees.</p>

        <p><b>Native Americans:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the arrival of white settlers in the 1750s, peoples of the Shakori, Eno, and  Sissipahaw tribes lived in the area. They formed a part of a larger trade network, as evidenced by the many arrowheads and other stone tools that turn up when the ground on Many Trees is plowed or dug. Three examples from Many Trees appear on the left. Their trading partners provided roughed-in 'blanks' that the local peoples could finish. In return, they would have provided corn or perhaps tobacco and other agricultural products.</p>
        <p>Under pressure from the colonists, the native peoples of the area may have joined in the Yamasee War of 1715. At one point their successes in the war threatened the continuation of the colony of South Carolina. Following the defeat of the Native Americans in 1717, these tribes shriveled in size and eventually merged into the Catawba tribe, which remains in existence today.</p>

        <p><b>Before the Civil War:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The home at Many Trees was built before the Civil War, most likely in 1857 by Fendol Southerland as he built out a cotton plantation on newly acquired land. Southerland owned 32 slaves who planted, harvested, and processed the cotton. In addition, they dug ditches to New Hope Creek to drain the land. As a part of their work, they also turned the giant wheel pictured on the left that powered a cotton gin to process the raw cotton. The wheel still stands in the barn on the property. By the start of the Civil War, Many Trees was the third largest cotton producer in Orange County.</p>

        <p><b>Civil War:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Trees stands near the site of some of the last combat in the Civil War. Following their defeat at Bentonville, Confederate troops retreated through the area. Confederate cavalry deployed to protect their line of march along the line of the nearby New Hope Creek and Stagecoach Road. During the engagement at Morrisville on April 15, 1865, Union cavalry attacked across the New Hope in the vicinity of Many Trees. After four hours of fighting, the Confederates withdrew, perhaps saving Many Trees from being burned as many plantations were at that time. The Confederates surrendered three days later in nearby Durham, effectively ending the war.</p>

        <p><b>After the Civil War:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Southerland remained on his former plantation and continued growing cotton. In the late 1870s, growing global competition significantly depressed prices from pre-Civil War levels. For planters who lived on credit, as most did, this was disastrous. Southerland was among those affected. In 1878, in failing health, he hung himself in the barn. Around this time, the main house would have looked like the picture to the left. Southerland's granddaughter continued farming the land for decades until the early 1900s. Many Trees was next briefly owned by a famous University of North Carolina professor, Horace Williams. Between 1909 and 1940, the property passed through the hands of a series of land and timber companies. Many of the fields disappeared under new growth forest and the buildings crumbled. In 1940, the Mayor of Chapel Hill, John xxxxxxx, and his wife, Ola Maie, bought the property and began to restore it. They lived on the farm for more than fifty years</p>

She recalls playing in the fields as a child, turning up arrowheads like those pictured on this page. June has continued her parents' work restoring the farm, rebuilding the barn from a state of near collapse to where it appears as it would have during the time of slavery.</p>

        <p><b>Historical Preservation:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Preservation of Many Trees would have both direct and indirect benefits to the Durham community and beyond. It could be used as a facility to teach school children and the public about the role of cotton and slavery in the antebellum South.</p>
        <p>As Preservation North Carolina notes, historic preservation of one property inspires further preservation elsewhere, adding to the local tax base and stimulating economic development. It adds to the 'cultural capital' of a locale, attracting tourism.</p>
        <p>Historic preservation of Many Trees is consistent with preserving wildlife habitat, providing an educational facility, and operating as a bed and breakfast.</p>

        <p><b>Wild Life Preserve:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;You might see a great blue heron take flight from the pond as you turn in the front to drive. Lesser green herons and hawks also inhabit the edge of the pond, watching for prey. Fox abound, and although they are officially red or gray, June has seen a solid black one and one that was completely bright orange. Of course, there are the graceful deer as well as wild turkeys, turkey vultures, bats, pileated woodpeckers, and song birds. If you walk through the forest, you'll find Running Cedar and a variety of understory plants and mushrooms. Depending on whether you are on higher land or approaching the gullies that dip into the wildlife preserve, you'll find a variety of native trees ranging from climax species such as oak and hickory to understory trees like dogwood and paw paw.</p>
        <p>Many Trees is located near several major roads, and  development is removing habitat all around it. This has already led to loss of some species. For instance, June no longer sees flying squirrels, bobwhite, or whippoorwill. The need to preserve what remains is becoming intense if more species are not to be lost.</p>

        <p><b>Organic Farming</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Durham County has lost all but a few of its farms. By contrast, several acres of Many Trees is being set aside for organic farming and a greatly needed farmer's market. The area is lucky to have a branch of Central Carolina Community College in Pittsboro teach permaculture and farming techniques for those interested in starting a small farm. The non-profit Carolina Farm Stewardship Association is also located in Pittsboro and would be a great resource for anyone wanting to farm here. The Triangle Land Conservancy is eager to preserve both forests and farms in the area.</p>

        <p><b>Bed and Breakfast</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The guest room is June's favorite room in which to awaken. As part of the building that was originally the kitchen, it has three exterior sides, with wonderful large windows in two, and a 15-pane glass door to the patio in the third. The original wood ceiling is exposed and a silent ceiling fan moves the air on a warm night.</p>
        <p>The adjacent study has a built-in single bed and large 14-foot arched window from the old Alberto Mill in nearby Carrboro. Each room has its own bath.</p>
        <p>Breakfast or tea could be served in the formal dining room, on one of two patios, or in the Florida room that is shown on the left.</p>

        <p><b>Education:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from its potential for teaching North Carolina history, Many Trees has many possible uses as an educational facility. In the past there have been T'ai Chi classes, filming of an art program for Public Television, a 'mile of art' exhibit, a public meeting by the Durham Historical Society, and a project by the students at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics. If used as a wildlife preserve, it could be used to teach about the ecology of the North Carolina Piedmont. If converted to an organic farm, it could also be used as a teaching facility for organic farming techniques. In any of these uses, Many Trees could also provide a place to hold art classes, teach tai chi chuan or yoga, provide horseback lessons, or any other form of instruction that benefits from being held outdoors.</p>

        <p><b>Recreation:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Trees' 68-acre site includes plenty of space for pasture, riding rings, or other outdoor recreations. A horse farm is just around the corner on Stagecoach Road. There are many places to walk on the farm, and it's a pleasant hike through the woods to the adjacent wildlife preserve. Many Trees is a short drive to Jordan Lake for boating, swimming, and camping.</p>
