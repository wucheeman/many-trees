She agrees that the best way to present these pictures is on a separate page, linked from the front page. It could be entitled "Other Buildings and Features" or something similar.

The Pump House. Circa 1941. It includes one of the two hand-dug and rock-lilned wells circa 1857.

The Smoke House. Circa 1857.

The Swimming Pool. Needs to be redone or filled.

The Yellow House. Circa 1941. Built from scraps from UNC-Chapel Hill and Camp Butner during World War II.
